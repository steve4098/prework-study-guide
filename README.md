# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

This project has been designed as part of the Prework modules.
The rationale for this project is twofold: firstly to allow the chance to practice the application of various programming languages and secondly as a repository of information learned during the Prework modules.
This webpage will allow easy access to the notes made during the Prework modules.
There are a list of notes under each subheading to provide information on each language.
